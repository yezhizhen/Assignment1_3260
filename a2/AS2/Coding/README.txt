HERE I introduce extra features:

1. Particle System (10%)

	Particle system is simulated with two constraint:
		
		 further from the car,  wider the range, but  smaller the number
			This is achieved using specific mathematical model
		
		 higher is the velocity(speed),	larger the number of particles
		 

2.	Changing view/Additional View (5%)

	press 1 to zoom in
	press 2 to zoom out
	
**	press 3 to change several viewpoint
	first view : normal view
	second view: y view;
	third view: car driver's view space. (You may not see the car body, but you absolutely have the view of car driver)
	
This control is circular, so you can go from state 3 to 1 by pressing '3' again.
3.	changing light (5%)
	
	there is a light doing uniform circular motion.
	You can notice it by the changing of shadow of wheels and grounds.
	
	
4. Additional Movements for viechel (5%)
	
	Press W to lift the car to the sky
	Press D to put the car down
	Press K to rotate the car at the same place, and you can do it when car is moving.
